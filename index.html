            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2014 by agricultural enthusiasts, Micro Seeds began as a small family business with a simple mission: to provide farmers with the highest quality seeds for better yields. What started as a local seed supplier has grown into a trusted agritech company serving farmers across multiple states.
                
                Our journey has been marked by continuous innovation, from traditional seed breeding to incorporating modern agricultural techniques and precision farming methods. Today, we're proud to be trusted by thousands of farmers who rely on our products for their livelihood.
                
                We believe that agriculture is not just about growing crops – it's about nurturing communities, preserving traditions, and building a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
